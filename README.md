# Copilot Neural Swarm

A real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring GitHub Copilot activity across pull requests in your organization's repositories. Command your AI clone army with this hacker-style neural interface.

**Built with TypeScript for enhanced reliability and type safety.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

**Important**: This tool requires access to your GitHub repositories and monitors Copilot activity. Please be aware:

- The tool accesses repository data and pull request information
- OAuth tokens are stored locally in your system configuration directory
- **Use responsibly**: Do not abuse monitoring capabilities or violate GitHub's terms of service
- **Enterprise users**: Ensure compliance with your organization's security policies
- **Data privacy**: Be mindful of what repositories you monitor, especially those containing sensitive information

## üö® Cost Warning - Automated Workflows

**CRITICAL**: This tool will automatically instruct the Copilot agent to fix issues and will automatically run workflows once the agent is done. **This process will be repeated indefinitely and may result in very high usage of GitHub Action runner minutes, incurring significant costs.**

- **Set billing limits**: Configure spending limits in your GitHub billing settings before using this tool
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your GitHub Actions usage and costs
- **Understand automation**: The tool runs continuously and triggers workflows automatically
- **Enterprise impact**: High runner minute usage can quickly exceed organizational budgets

**By using this tool, you acknowledge that you understand these cost implications and will monitor and limit your GitHub Actions usage appropriately.**

By using this tool, you acknowledge that you understand these implications and will use it responsibly and in accordance with GitHub's terms of service.

## Understanding the Interface

The terminal interface shows:

- **Pull Request Table**: PRs assigned to both you and GitHub Copilot
- **Activity Log**: Real-time API calls and system events
- **Status Bar**: Live metrics and refresh countdown
- **Copilot Status**: Current Copilot activity state

### Status Indicators

- **üîÑ AI Clone Working**: Active neural swarm detected
- **‚è≥ Waiting for Feedback**: Minion completed task, awaiting orders
- **‚ùå Error**: Neural network malfunction detected
- **‚ÑπÔ∏è No Activity**: Swarm idle, no recent neural events

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher
- **GitHub Account**: With access to repositories you want to monitor
- **GitHub OAuth App**: Required for authentication (setup is guided)
