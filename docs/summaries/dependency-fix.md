# Dependency Resolution Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The npm install error has been successfully fixed!

### 🔍 **Problem**

- Framer Motion v10.16.16 only supported React ^18.0.0
- Project was using React 19.0.0
- Peer dependency conflict prevented installation

### 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

1. **Updated Framer Motion**: Upgraded from `^10.16.16` to `^12.16.0`

   - Latest version supports both React 18 and 19: `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`
   - Maintains full compatibility with existing code

2. **Added Missing Peer Dependency**: Added `@emotion/is-prop-valid` ^1.2.1

   - Required by Framer Motion for prop validation

3. **Fixed TypeScript Issue**: Resolved useEffect return value issue in App.tsx

   - Added proper cleanup function for all code paths

4. **Verified Installation**:
   - ✅ Clean install successful
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
   - ✅ Build process works
   - ✅ Demo functionality intact
