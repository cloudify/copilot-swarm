# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the issues that were fixed from the TODO.md backlog.

## ✅ Issue 1: Provide sample logs when asking Copilot to fix failed jobs

**Problem**: When Copilot is asked to fix failed jobs, no context about the actual errors was provided.

**Solution**:

- Added `collectFailureLogs()` function in `src/utils/github.ts` that:
  - Fetches logs from the most recent failed workflow runs
  - Extracts error lines containing keywords like 'error', 'failed', 'exception', '✗', '❌'
  - Limits to 2 failed runs and 2 failed jobs per run to avoid overwhelming comments
  - Formats the logs as markdown code blocks
- Modified the fix comment generation to include sample logs in the comment sent to Copilot

**Files Changed**: `src/utils/github.ts`

## ✅ Issue 2: Ignore failures from jobs with "Danger" in the name

**Problem**: Jobs with "Danger" in the name should be ignored when determining if auto-fixes are needed.

**Solution**:

- Verified existing implementation in `src/utils/github.ts` (lines 882-884)
- The filter already correctly excludes checks containing "danger" (case insensitive):
  ```typescript
  const filteredChecks = failedChecks.filter(
    (check) => !check.toLowerCase().includes("danger")
  );
  ```

**Files Changed**: None (already implemented correctly)

## ✅ Issue 3: Handle "cannot be rerun" errors gracefully

**Problem**: Auto-approve rerun failed with cryptic error messages like "Run cannot be rerun; its workflow file may be broken or you lack the required 'workflow' scope"

**Solution**:

- Added specific error handling in `src/utils/github.ts` for workflow rerun failures
- Enhanced error detection to identify specific "cannot be rerun" scenarios:
  - Workflow file may be broken
  - Missing required 'workflow' scope
  - Run cannot be rerun for other reasons
- Changed error logging from "error" to "warning" level for these expected scenarios
- Improved error message clarity

**Files Changed**: `src/utils/github.ts`

## ✅ Issue 4: Prevent duplicate status message modifiers

**Problem**: Status messages sometimes contained repeated phrases like "Waiting for feedback (full workflow rerun triggered) (full workflow rerun triggered)"

**Solution**:

- Refactored status message building in `src/utils/github.ts` to use arrays for collecting modifiers
- Implemented deduplication logic to prevent the same modifier from being added multiple times:
  ```typescript
  const statusModifiers: string[] = [];
  if (!statusModifiers.includes("failed jobs rerun triggered")) {
    statusModifiers.push("failed jobs rerun triggered");
  }
  ```
- Added similar protection for "resume requested" messages
- Properly join modifiers at the end: `statusMsg += ` (${statusModifiers.join(", ")})`

**Files Changed**: `src/utils/github.ts`

## ✅ Issue 5: Cache username to avoid logging on every refresh

**Problem**: The message "Using username: <USER>" appeared on each refresh, indicating username was being fetched repeatedly.

**Solution**:

- Added `cachedUsername` property to `MonitorEngine` class in `src/MonitorEngine.ts`
- Modified `refreshData()` method to cache username on first fetch
- Username is now only logged once when first retrieved
- Subsequent refreshes use the cached value without logging

**Files Changed**: `src/MonitorEngine.ts`

## Testing

All fixes have been implemented and tested:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ Build process completes without issues

## Benefits

1. **Better Copilot Context**: Copilot now receives actual error logs, improving fix quality
2. **Cleaner Logs**: No more duplicate status messages or repeated username logging
3. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of workflow rerun limitations
4. **Improved Performance**: Username caching reduces unnecessary API calls
5. **Safer Operations**: Danger jobs are properly filtered out as intended

All issues from the TODO.md backlog have been successfully resolved! 🎉
